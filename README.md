KekBot is a friendly meme and community based bot! Designed completely from the ground up, this bot is constantly being updated with new features and being maintained to keep up with Discord's constant API changes. From memes, to admin tools, to fun minigames to kill time, KekBot is meant to be an all-in-one solution for any server. (Though it won't get jealous if you decide to add another bot.)

KekBot is also open-source, meaning that anyone interesting in coding their own bots (or trying to selfhost KekBot) can easily dig through the code, and see just how it ticks. 

That said, there is little to no documentation on what most of the code does, or how to go about hosting the bot by yourself, this started out as a project for me to learn Java, and as a result you may find code that is not the most optimal. However, I feel like it can still serve as a good learning point for someone getting a feel for the Java language as there's plenty of room for experimentation if you decide to play around with KekBot's code.
